# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 4: July 9, 2018
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Tried to pull down current version of my blog I created this weekend with MIMO to copy to my hardrive, but got a little mixed up. Went back and forth from Desktop GIT, GitHub online, and through the atom git portal. Called it a day on that project, ended up just pulling the files down from GH and copying them into a folder, then taking the consolidated files and copy pasting them over the files in my desktop folder. Spent 20 mins on a MIMO Hack a Website challenge.


**Thoughts:** Git and Git Hub are very challenging. I seem to understand it fine when editing in the browser, doing edits on the fly. I even forked this repo. I hope I'm doing it right, but I often feel like I'm doing things I don't understand..........YET. I just don't fully understand YET. But those clarity and "AHA" moments are what makes this field so rewarding. Need to follow up with posting my progress from days 1-3. They are on my current repo for the blog I created. 

Feeling tired and a little like "what next?" I'm going to formulate my plan :)
