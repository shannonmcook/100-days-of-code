# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 4: July 9, 2018


**Today's Progress**: Tried to pull down current version of my blog I created this weekend with MIMO to copy to my hardrive, but got a little mixed up. Went back and forth from Desktop GIT, GitHub online, and through the atom git portal. Called it a day on that project, ended up just pulling the files down from GH and copying them into a folder, then taking the consolidated files and copy pasting them over the files in my desktop folder. Spent 20 mins on a MIMO Hack a Website challenge.


**Thoughts:** Git and Git Hub are very challenging. I seem to understand it fine when editing in the browser, doing edits on the fly. I even forked this repo. I hope I'm doing it right, but I often feel like I'm doing things I don't understand..........YET. I just don't fully understand YET. But those clarity and "AHA" moments are what makes this field so rewarding. Need to follow up with posting my progress from days 1-3. They are on my current repo for the blog I created. 

Feeling tired and a little like "what next?" I'm going to formulate my plan :)

**Today's Progress**: I did not make a Git Commit, but I tweeted:

Day 5 - spent some time learning about #SQL fundamentals. Took advantage of the Udemy sale and signed up for @techedrob's course! Getting everything set up - full speed ahead! #100daysofCode

**Thoughts:** I really enjoyed trying to identify parts of a SQL database and gain entry. I was feeling a little overwhelmed with what to code and where to start. I'd like to go back to my blog I made with the MIMO app and change some styles and add things. In the mean time, while I was researching tutorials, I was pointed to the Udemy website, and they were on sale. I was particulaly drawn to a course that helps guide almost 25 websites and creations, so I took full advantage of the sale. I spent most of the time getting set up, which didn't feel like I was doing actual coding, but the SQL exploration before I signed up still counts. And I did finish the night getting started with the first chapter of The Complete Web Developer Course 2.0, so I feel good about where it will lead.
